  - 'Note: no file named SEEDNAME_band.labelinfo.dat found. You are probably using
    a version of Wannier90 before 3.0. There, the labels associated with each k-points
    were not printed in output and there were also cases in which points were not
    calculated (see issue #195 on the Wannier90 GitHub page). I will anyway try to
    do my best to assign labels, but the assignment might be wrong (especially if
    there are path discontinuities).'
