# v2.0.0

## New features
- Plugin fully migrated to AiiDA 1.0. This version still supports both python 2.7 and python 3.x (>= 3.5) [[#32]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/32) [[#34]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/34) [[#63]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/63) [[#64]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/64) [[#66]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/66)

- Added parser for `.labelinfo.dat` file to get correct high-symmetry k-point labels in band_parser [[#88]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/88)

- Added support for the SCDM method [[#61]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/61)

## Fixes and general improvements

- Implemented the `input_filename` and `output_filename` config options, replacing the `seedname` options. In this way, `verdi calcjob inputcat/outputcat` work as expected [[#42]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/42)

- Automatically retrieving all known output files generated by Wannier90 [[#79]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/79) [[#80]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/80)

- Improved some parser key names [[#78]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/78)

- Parser: Add missing catch of "NotExistent" when kpoints_path is not given [[#55]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/55)

- Removed opening transport in `prepare_for_submission`, avoiding the risk to open too many SSH connections. Note that this means that now the `remote_input_folder` and the `local_input_folder` inputs are mutually exclusive [[#83]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/83)

## Tests and documentation

- Improved test suite and continuous integration (including pre-commit tests), and using now AiiDA-provided pytest tools [[#33]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/33) [[#44]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/44) [[#49]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/49) [[#51]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/51) [[#54]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/54) [[#57]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/57) [[#65]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/65)

- Added tests to check how projections are created [[#81]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/81) [[#85]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/85) [[#87]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/87)

- General update of the documentation to include all new changes [[#91]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/91) [[#52]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/52)

- Use aiida calcjob directive in documentation [[#86]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/86) 

- Example of GaAs wannierization (both as a single submission, and via a workchain using Quantum ESPRESSO) [[#77]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/77) [[#84]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-wannier90/pull/84)
