This is an example launcher of a minimal workchain to compute the Wannier
functions of GaAs using Quantum ESPRESSO for the first-principles part,
followed by Wannier90.

For detailed instructions and documentation, you can check the
[documentation](https://aiida-wannier90.readthedocs.io/) (its source
can be found in the folder `docs/source/tutorial_minimal_workflow.rst`).
