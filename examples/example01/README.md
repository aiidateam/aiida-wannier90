This is an example launcher of a calculation to compute the Wannier
functions of GaAs using Wannier90 (optionally preceded by
a Quantum ESPRESSO calculation using the `aiida-quantumespresso` package).

For detailed instructions and documentation, you can check the
[documentation](https://aiida-wannier90.readthedocs.io/) (its source
can be found in the folder `docs/source/tutorial_calculation.rst`).
